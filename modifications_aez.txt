
Issue 1 (assertion failure when And/Or is applied to less than 2 arguments):

    Failing execution:
        smt.ml mk_cnf ->
            when called with a formula in sform but containing a 'Comb (Or lst)' such that len(lst) < 2,
            it results in an assertion failure

    Solutions proposed (the second one has been used):
        1. Add a case to handle Comb (Or [])
        2. Never use And/Or combinators with less than 2 arguments
        (And combinators are also involved because they are changed to Or when negating)

Issue 2 (Not_found exception, see ex000.lus for a minimal failing example):

    Failing execution (ex000.lus, base case for k=0):
        smt.ml entails -> call to assume
        smt.ml assume -> call to CSolver.assume
        solver.ml assume -> call to init_solver
        solver.ml init_solver -> call to add_clauses
        solver.ml add_clauses -> call to add_clause
        solver.ml add_clause -> case 3 ([a]), call to cancel_until
        solver.ml cancel_until ->
            called with the argument lvl=0.
            both 'env.trail_lim' and 'env.tenv_queue' have size 1.
            'Vec.get env.tenv_queue lvl' raise 'Not_found' because 'env.tenv_queue'
            has the default ('dummy') element as first element ('Th.empty ()').

    Solution proposed:
        Change the behavior of the method Vec.get and Vec.last (vec.ml)
        so that dummy elements are treated like any other element
